Machine learning model to predict stroke risk based on healthcare data
# Predictive Model for Stroke Risk

## Overview
This project is designed to predict the risk of stroke based on a dataset containing factors such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, and other health indicators. The goal is to create a machine learning model that can predict whether an individual is at risk of having a stroke.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from the **Kenya healthcare stroke data**. It contains various columns representing demographic and health-related information:

- **gender**: Gender of the patient
- **age**: Age of the patient
- **hypertension**: Whether the patient has hypertension
- **heart_disease**: Whether the patient has heart disease
- **ever_married**: Marital status of the patient
- **work_type**: Type of work the patient does
- **residence_type**: Type of residence (Urban/Rural)
- **avg_glucose_level**: Average glucose level
- **bmi**: Body mass index (BMI)
- **smoking_status**: Whether the patient smokes
- **stroke**: Target variable (1 if the patient had a stroke, 0 otherwise)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
- SHAP (for interpretability)
- Jupyter Notebooks
